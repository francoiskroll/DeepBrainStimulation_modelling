# DeepBrainStimulation_modelling

Computational modelling project looking at how a neuron from the subthalamic nucleus behaves under non-conventional deep brain stimulation waveforms.

The model runs on NEURON (https://www.neuron.yale.edu). Data created by running the model were exported from NEURON and analysed in R (scripts included).

The original model was created by:

Miocinovic, S. _et al._ Computational analysis of subthalamic nucleus and lenticular fasciculus activation during therapeutic deep brain stimulation. _J. Neurophysiol._ **96**, 1569â€“1580 (2006).

And is available here:

The workings of the model, the improvements I made, and the data processing R script are detailed in the Material and Methods section of the Master thesis pdf file.
