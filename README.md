# DeepBrainStimulation_modelling

Computational modelling project looking at how a neuron from the subthalamic nucleus behaves under non-conventional deep brain stimulation waveforms. 

This was my master's thesis project for the Master in Bioinformatics and Modelling at Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Belgium. (http://www.bioinfomaster.ulb.ac.be/MBM-EN/). This project was done in collaboration with Myles Mc Laughlin's laboratory at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KUL), Belgium.

The model runs on NEURON (https://www.neuron.yale.edu). Data created by running the model were exported from NEURON and analysed in R (scripts included). The waveform files were created with MatLab scripts written by Myles Mc Laughlin (KUL).

The original model was created by:

Miocinovic, S. _et al._ Computational analysis of subthalamic nucleus and lenticular fasciculus activation during therapeutic deep brain stimulation. _J. Neurophysiol._ **96**, 1569–1580 (2006).

And is available here:

The workings of the model, the improvements I made, and the data processing R scripts are detailed in the Material and Methods section of the Master thesis pdf file.

Please feel free to contact me for questions if you would like to work on this model:
