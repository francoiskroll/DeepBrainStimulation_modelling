# DeepBrainStimulation_modelling
Computational modelling project looking at how a neuron from the subthalamic nucleus behaves under non-conventional deep brain stimulation waveforms.

The model used is originally from:
Miocinovic, S. _et al._ Computational analysis of subthalamic nucleus and lenticular fasciculus activation during therapeutic deep brain stimulation. _J. Neurophysiol._ **96**, 1569â€“1580 (2006).

Improvements were made to this model for the purpose of the project (details in the pdf file).
